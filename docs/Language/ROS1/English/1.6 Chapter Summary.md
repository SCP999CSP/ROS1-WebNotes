# 1.6 Chapter Summary

This chapter primarily introduced the theoretical knowledge of ROS, including its related concepts, design goals, and development history. We installed ROS and set up an integrated development environment for it, wrote our first simple ROS program, and gained a macro-level understanding of the ROS implementation architecture. The door to ROS is now open, and we are about to embark on a new journey.
