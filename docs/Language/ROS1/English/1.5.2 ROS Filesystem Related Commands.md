# 1.5.2 ROS Filesystem Related Commands

The ROS filesystem is fundamentally still part of the operating system's files. While standard Linux commands can be used to manipulate these files, ROS provides specialized commands similar to Linux commands for an improved user experience. These ROS-specific commands are more concise and efficient compared to native Linux commands. File operations primarily involve creating, deleting, modifying, querying, and executing. Next, we will introduce some commonly used ROS filesystem commands from these five perspectives.

## 1. Create

- `catkin_create_pkg custom_package_name dependencies` === Create a new ROS package
- `sudo apt install xxx` === Install a ROS package

## 2. Delete

- `sudo apt purge xxx` === Delete a specific package

## 3. Query

- `rospack list` === List all packages
- `rospack find package_name` === Check if a specific package exists; if it does, return its installation path
- `roscd package_name` === Navigate into a specific package directory
- `rosls package_name` === List files within a specific package
- `apt search xxx` === Search for a specific package

## 4. Modify

- `rosed package_name file_name` === Modify files within a package
- Requires vim to be installed
- **Example:** `rosed turtlesim Color.msg`

## 5. Execute

### 5.1 roscore

**roscore** === A collection of ROS system prerequisite nodes and programs. roscore must be running for ROS nodes to communicate.

roscore will start:

- ROS Master
- ROS Parameter Server  
- rosout logging node

Usage:

```bash
roscore
```

Or (with specified port):

```bash
roscore -p xxxx
```

### 5.2 rosrun

**rosrun package_name executable_name** === Run specified ROS node

**Example:** `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node`

### 5.3 roslaunch

**roslaunch package_name launch_file_name** === Execute launch file from a specific package
