# 1.3.2 HelloWorld

This section builds upon section 1.3.1. Assuming you have already created a ROS workspace and a ROS package, you can now proceed to the core steps. Use Python to implement the program as follows:

#### 1. Navigate to the ROS package, add a scripts directory, and edit the Python file

text

```
cd ros_package
mkdir scripts
```



Create a new Python file: (The filename can be customized)

python

```
#! /usr/bin/env python

"""
    Python Version HelloWorld

"""
import rospy

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rospy.init_node("Hello")
    rospy.loginfo("Hello World!!!!")
```



#### 2. Add execute permissions to the Python file

text

```
chmod +x custom_filename.py
```



#### 3. Edit the CMakeLists.txt file in the ROS package

text

```
catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS scripts/custom_filename.py
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)
```



#### 4. Navigate to the workspace directory and compile

text

```
cd custom_workspace_name
catkin_make
```



#### 5. Navigate to the workspace directory and execute

**First, start command line 1:**

text

```
roscore
```



**Then start command line 2:**

text

```
cd workspace
source ./devel/setup.bash
rosrun package_name custom_filename.py
```



Output result: `Hello World!!!!`
