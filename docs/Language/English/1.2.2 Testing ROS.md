### 1.2.2 Testing ROS

ROS includes some demo programs that can be used to verify whether the ROS environment is functioning correctly.

1. First, open three terminal windows (Ctrl + Alt + T)
2. Terminal 1: Type `roscore`
3. Terminal 2: Type `rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node` (a graphical window will pop up)
4. Terminal 3: Type `rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key` (use arrow keys in Terminal 3 to control the turtle's movement in Terminal 2)

The final result should appear as shown below:
