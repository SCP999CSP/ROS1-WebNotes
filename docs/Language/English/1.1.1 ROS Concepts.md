# 1.1.1 ROS Concepts

**ROS stands for Robot Operating System**

- ROS is an **open-source** meta-operating system designed for robots
- ROS integrates a large number of tools, libraries, and protocols, providing functionality similar to that of an operating system to simplify robot control
- It also offers tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across **multiple computers**. In some aspects, ROS resembles a "robot framework"
- ROS designers describe it as "**ROS = Plumbing + Tools + Capabilities + Ecosystem**", meaning ROS is a collection of communication mechanisms, tool packages, high-level robotic capabilities, and the robotics ecosystem
